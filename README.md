Data, model code and output files associated with manuscript 'van de Velde et al., 2020, PNAS, doi:10.1073/pnas.2008235117'

Three models were developed in the manuscript and described in the Supplementary Information:

1. A detailed one-dimensional reactive transport model for marine sediments (SI Appendix Section 2)
 -> files are located in folder 'Sediment model 1'

2. A generalised and simplified version of the reactive-transport model (SI Appendix Section 3)
 -> files are located in folder 'Sediment model 2'
 
3. A three-box ocean geochemistry model (SI Appendix Section 4)
 -> files are located in folder 'Ocean model 1'
 
All models have been coded in R, and should be able to be run using the files supplied.
In case of any problems, please contact the corresponding authors.
